# go-square

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/celestiaorg/go-square/v2.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/celestiaorg/go-square/v2)

`go-square` is a Go module that provides data structures and utilities for interacting with data squares in the Celestia network. The data square is a special form of block serialization in the Celestia blockchain designed for sampling. This repo deals with the original data square which is distinct from the extended data square. Operations on the extended data square are handled by [rsmt2d](https://github.com/celestiaorg/rsmt2d).

## Branches and Releasing

This repo has one long living development branch `main`, for changes targeting the next major version as well as long living branches for each prior major version i.e. `v1.x`. Non breaking changes may be backported to these branches. This repo follows [semver](https://www.semver.org) versioning.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

This repo attempts to conform to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so PR titles should ideally start with `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, or `test:` because this helps with semantic versioning and changelog generation. It is especially important to include an `!` (e.g. `feat!:`) if the PR includes a breaking change.
