Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

This repo attempts to conform to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so PR titles should ideally start with `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, or `test:` because this helps with semantic versioning and changelog generation. It is especially important to include an `!` (e.g. `feat!:`) if the PR includes a breaking change.
